Life in 3 Dimensions
===============================================

This is a github project website to showcase our final project for [ELEC 327](http://elec327.github.io/) utilizing an MSP430 G2553 and SPI communications to implement Joseph Conway's "Game of Life" on a cube.

Quick overview: 
----------------
The user has the ability to traverse/set the initial states of cells on the cube using the button array on each face of the cube. When the user is satisfied with his/her setup, after a brief period of inactivity, the Game of Life simulation begins.
